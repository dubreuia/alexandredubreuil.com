## Generative Music

"Generative art is an artwork partially or completely created by an autonomous 
system." This definition is good, but not really fun. Let's other ways of
seeing generative music. 

### Make music without being a musician

Maybe you don't know how to **improvise**, maybe you need help 
to **compose**. Either way, a generative algorithm can help you
do it.

By interacting with a machine, you can find new ideas, discover new
sounds, or do even things you cannot by yourself. The machine becomes an
extension of our creativity.

### "Why you should build silly things" - Monica Dinculescu
    
It is okay to make art without taking ourselves seriously. Generative
music is a good way of doing that, because those kind of systems can
be **interacted with** easily.

[Monica Dinculescu - Why you should build silly things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkiFjzQgJtg)

### Helping people build generative systems

To make generative art, you need **autonomous systems**
that makes it possible. As software developers, this is our role
to provide that, whether it is for an art exhibit, a generative
radio, or a fun website.

### "The weird and the strange is good" - Brian Eno

Generative systems makes tons of mistakes (also humans), 
**but mistakes are good**. They form the basic mechanism with
which we learn and are important in the creation process. 

### Representation: MIDI

MIDI is a musical representation analogous to **sheet music**,
where note has a pitch, velocity, and time.

Working with MIDI shows the underlying **structure of the music**,
but doesn't define the actual sound, you'll need to use instruments (numeric or analogic).

![MIDI diagram](../../conferences/music-generation-with-magenta/resources/midi.png)

### Representation: audio

Working with audio is harder because you have to handle 16000 samples per 
seconds (at least) and keep track of the general structure. Generating audio 
is more direct than MIDI.

It is more direct because you don't need the extra step of using instruments
to play the score.

### Machine Learning

Hand crafting the rules of a painting or the rules of a music style might be
a hard task. That's why Machine Learning is so interesting in arts: it can
learn complex functions.

### Music generation with RNNs (MIDI)

<img width="300px" alt="RNN diagram" src="../../conferences/music-generation-with-magenta/resources/rnn.png">
<!-- https://www.asimovinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/rnn.png -->

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) solves two important properties 
for music generation: they **operate on sequences for the inputs 
and outputs** and they **can remember past events**.

### Long-term structure with LSTMs (MIDI)

<img width="300px" alt="LSTM diagram" src="../../conferences/music-generation-with-magenta/resources/lstm.png">
<!-- https://www.asimovinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/lstm.png -->
          
Most RNN uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cells, since by themselves, RNNs
are hard to train because of the problems of vanishing and exploding gradient,
making long-term dependencies hard to learn.

By using **input, output and forget gates** in the cell, LSTMs can
learn mechanisms to keep or forget information as they go.

### Latent space interpolation with VAEs (MIDI)

<img width="300px" alt="VAE diagram" src="../../conferences/music-generation-with-magenta/resources/vae.png">
<!-- https://www.asimovinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/vae.png -->

Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are a pair of networks where an encoder reduces
the input to a lower dimensionality (**latent space**), from which
a decoder tries to reproduce the input.

The latent space is continuous and follows a probability distribution, meaning
it is possible to sample from it. VAEs are inherently generative models: they
can **sample** and **interpolate** (smoothly move in
the latent space) between two points.

### Audio generation with WaveNet Autoencoders (audio)

![Wavenet diagram](../../conferences/music-generation-with-magenta/resources/wavenet.png)
<!-- https://magenta.tensorflow.org/assets/nsynth_05_18_17/encoder-decoder.png -->

WaveNet is a convolutional neural network (CNN) taking raw signal as an input
and synthesizing output audio sample by sample.

The WaveNet Autoencoder present in Magenta is a Wavenet-style AE network
capable of learning its own temporal embedding, resulting in a latent space
from which is it possible to **sample ** and **mix**
elements.

### What's in Magenta?

Here are some networks we'll be using in this presentation and live code.
Not all Magenta models are listed, but the main ones for music generation are.

## Live code: Generate a track

### STEP 1: make everything sound like a cat.

We'll use NSynth to mix cat sounds with other sounds.

### STEP 1: The sounds

                       save_paths=[output])
```

### STEP 1: GANSynth

As shown, the NSynth instrument is nice, but really slow for the
audio synthesis. You should use **GANSynth**.

```

### Wrapping up

This generative music demo helped us improvise and compose around an
idea: a track composed of a percussion, a melody, and a cat
&#x1F63A;. We could **interact** with the system
and it helped us improvise around a theme.

### Can we do better?

Was it perfect? No, we had little happy accidents.

<img width="33%" alt="Bob Ross" src="../../conferences/music-generation-with-magenta/resources/bob-ross.jpg">
<!-- https://2.bp.blogspot.com/_s5_5vgBh1Zo/TJVmnBJW-bI/AAAAAAAAAHc/Mcgu8_el_84/s1600/Bob_Ross.jpg -->

Maybe we could have had more control over the sequences. Maybe we
wanted to improvise around a **musical style**,
or a **specific structure**.

## Training

### Why?

The pre-trained models in Magenta are good, but if for example
you want to generate a **specific style**, generate a
**specific time signature** (3/4 for example), or a
**specific instrument** (cello for example) you'll
need to train your own.

### Datasets: LAKHS (MIDI)

A good place to start is the 
[LAKHS dataset](https://colinraffel.com/projects/lmd/), a 
180,000 MIDI files dataset, (partially) matched with the 
[Million Song Dataset](http://millionsongdataset.com/)
(metadata like artist, release, genre).

### Datasets: NSynth (audio)

A large-scale and high-quality dataset of annotated musical notes.
Training audio requires lots of resources, but can be achieved using
GANSynth.

See the [NSynth Dataset](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/datasets/nsynth).

### Building the dataset

From MIDI, ABCNotation, MusicXML files to <code>NoteSequence</code>.

```bash
convert_dir_to_note_sequences \
--input_dir="/path/to/dataset/jazz_midi/drums/v1" \
--output_file="/tmp/notesequences.tfrecord" \
--recursive
```
```bash
...
Converted MIDI file /path/to/dataset/jazz_midi/drums/v1/TRVUCSW12903CF536D.mid.
Converted MIDI file /path/to/dataset/jazz_midi/drums/v1/TRWSJLM128F92DF651.mid.
...
```

### Create SequenceExamples

The sequence examples are fed into the model, it contains a sequence
of inputs and a sequence of labels that represents the drum track.
Those are split to eval and training sets.

```bash
drums_rnn_create_dataset \
--config="drum_kit" \
--input="/tmp/notesequences.tfrecord" \
--output_dir="/tmp/drums_rnn/sequence_examples" \
--eval_ratio=0.10
```
```bash
...
DAGPipeline_DrumsExtractor_training_drum_track_lengths_in_bars:
[8,10): 1
[10,20): 8
[20,30): 8
[30,40): 29
[40,50): 1
[50,100): 2
...
```

### Train and evaluate the model

Launch the training, using a specific configuration and
hyperparameters.

```bash
drums_rnn_train \
--config="drum_kit" \
--run_dir="/tmp/drums_rnn/logdir/run1" \
--sequence_example_file="/tmp/drums_rnn/sequence_examples/training_drum_tracks.tfrecord" \
--hparams="batch_size=64,rnn_layer_sizes=[64,64]" \
--num_training_steps=20000
```
```bash

## Interaction with the outside world

### Python to everything using MIDI

Magenta can send MIDI, which is understood by basically everything
that makes sound: **DAWs** (like Ableton Live),
**software synthesizers** (like fluidsynth),
**hardware synthesizers** (though USB or MIDI cable),
etc.

### Magenta in the browser with Magenta.js

You can use Magenta and most of its models in the browser, using
Magenta.js (which in turns uses Tensorflow.js).
